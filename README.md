# gpr_circadian
The Jupyter notebooks used in my MSc project at the University of Exeter, on Quantifying Circadian Phase Shifts in Hospital Patients. 
Each notebook was used on a different data set: 
  synthetic data (created to understand the effects of sampling frequency), 
  duplicate data (experimental data measure twice),
  average data (the average of the experimental data)
The Duplicate Data notebook is the most extensive analysis.
